# Apple HealthKit and iOS 8

Apple is reportedly set to announce iOS 8 as part of their World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC). One of the expected software elements of iOS 8 is [HealthKit](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5772074/apple-healthkit-ios-8-announcement), a centralized location of health management information such as sleep records, emergency contact information, hydration and more.

HealthKit, from early reports, appears to be similar to Passbook, an application that lets users manage things like airline boarding passes, concert tickets, and more via the app. Select apps and partners, such as United Airlines and Eventbrite, are able to push their application data into Passbook for use there.
